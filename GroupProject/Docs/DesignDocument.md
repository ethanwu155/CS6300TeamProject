## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions
* This app does not maintain cross session state. For example if user completes adding Quiz or exits before finishing process, than process will start from the beginning. 
* Time and Date is provided by a utility class
* All data for Quiz application is stored locally on the phone. 

### 1.2 Constraints
* User must have smart phone

### 1.3 System Environment
* _Platform_: Android SDK
* _Operating Systems_: Android
* _User Environment_: Phone Application

## 2 Architecture Design

### 2.1 Component Diagram


### 2.2 Deployment Diagram
* Due to the lack of network requirements and all the data being stored locally, the application would be deployed on a single Android device and a deployment diagram would not be necessary.
